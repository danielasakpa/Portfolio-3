## Learnings
Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into the following areas:

- Responsive web design principles
- Effective use of React.js for building dynamic user interfaces
- Implementation of smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Integrating third-party services, such as Email.js, for form handling
- Customization and configuration of a personal portfolio template

## Challenges and Solutions
During the development process, I encountered several challenges, including:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
  - *Solution*: Utilized media queries and flexbox/grid layout for responsive design.

- **Integration with Email.js**: Setting up and integrating Email.js for the contact form.
  - *Solution*: Followed the Email.js documentation for React integration, handling form submissions.

- **Managing Project Data**: Organizing and managing project data in a clean and maintainable way.
  - *Solution*: Utilized separate data files (`src/assets/projectItem.js`) and mapped data dynamically.

## Tools and Technologies
This portfolio website was built using the following tools and technologies:

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for React.
- **Email.js**: Service for sending emails directly from the client side.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **npm**: Package manager for Node.js packages.
- **Git and GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform.
