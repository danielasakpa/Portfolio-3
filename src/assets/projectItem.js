        RapidAPI to connect to a real estate API that provided information on properties for sale or rent in various locations. This allowed users to search for properties by location, price range, and other criteria. Overall, building this personal 
        real estate website project was a great learning experience, as it allowed me to utilize and improve my skills in React, Tailwind, and API integration. It was also satisfying to create a functional and user-friendly platform for individuals to search for and view properties.`,
